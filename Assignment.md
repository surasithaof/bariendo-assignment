Implementing Doctor Appointment Web Application

## Frontend

Implement a responsive website (React / Next.js) with 5 features below:

1. [Customer] Register / Login

   - Email and Password

2. [Customer] Choose a free slot date and time

   - 1 slot is equal to 1 hour
   - An user can choose more than 1 slot a day (Maximum is 24 slots)
   - An user cannot choose any slot that is already reserved

3. [Customer] Show a list of daily reserved slot

4. [Provider] Login

   - Email and Password

5. [Provider] Show a list of upcoming appointments

## Backend

Implement back-end API (Node.js / Nest.js) for basic CRUD functionality and authentication

1. Registration and Login

   - Email and Password
   - Organizations will have multiple roles, including admin, doctor, patient
   - A doctor or patient can belong to multiple organizations.

2. Appointment Management

   - Doctors and patients can access and manage appointment slots within their respective
     organizations
   - Only appointment slots relevant to a user's organization will be visible to them

## Guideline

- You can add whatever you think will make the system better.
- You can assume the constraint and limitation on your own. (Such as the system
  can make reservations three months in advance)
- Assume that we can add/change the system whenever we like
- Donâ€™t forget the performance of the system
- Coding best practices
- If you cannot finish all of it, please write down left tasks, estimation time, and what to possibly
  improve to your project

Upon completion, please zip all the relevant files (excluding node_modules) and send
back to this email
If you have never used React / Node.js before, please put a note, when you submit, so
we are aware of it and can measure your ability to learn a new language. Please find an
example of the lo-fi wireframes of a patient journey and user structure below.

**Note** that you can add whatever you think will make the system better
